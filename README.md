I suggest using the .ipynb file. The results are already there and I explained everything. Also there might be a problem with python versions in the python module.

For using python file, first to setup everything, run the shell script named "setup.sh" (for creating venv and installing requirements) and then run .py file using python. For the first time you can run run.sh to setup and then run automatically. 
The results will be printed in the terminal and will also be stored in 2 csv files (I put them already in the repository).
