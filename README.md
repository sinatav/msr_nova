I suggest checking out the .ipynb file. The results are already there and I explained everything. Also running the code may took several minutes and a GitHub token is needed, and using the notebook can be a lot more efficient.

For using python file, FIRST go to .py code and insert github token and username in the code. Then to setup everything, run the shell script named "setup.sh" (for creating venv and installing requirements) and then run .py file using python. For the first time you can run run.sh to setup and then run automatically. 
The results will be printed in the terminal and will also be stored in 2 csv files (I put them already in the repository).
