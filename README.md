I suggest using the .ipynb file. The results are already there and I explained everything.

For using python file, first to setup everything, run the shell script (for creating venv and installing requirements) and then run .py file using python. 
The results will be printed in the terminal and will also be stored in 2 csv files (I put them already in the repository).
